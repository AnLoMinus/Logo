# [How to Design a Memorable Logo in 7 Steps](https://www.shopify.in/blog/how-to-design-logo)
- #### Good logos stick. Bad ones don’t.
- North American Vexillological Association, says flag designs should be simple enough that a child can draw them from memory. 
- Your logo is not your brand—you build that separately—but it will become the face of your brand.
- It will appear on your website, your products, your marketing, your in-store signage, and just about any other place where people interact with your brand. 
- In this guide, we’ll walk you through every step of the process to create a business logo from scratch—from choosing a color to hiring a designer—with the help of real in-house graphic artists. 

## What is a business logo for?
- A logo is a symbol that represents your brand and your brand’s personality through the simplest image possible. 
- Logos embody your brand in the minds of your customers. 
- Without one, they have nothing to latch onto. 
  - Here’s why: 
    - **`Humans learn from visual cues`**: 
      - If there’s something about your brand you want your customers to know, science says images are more effective than words in communicating it.
    - **`Logos let you create branded swag`**: 
      - Branded swag can be handed out at trade shows, given as gifts to potential clients, and even sold in-store.
      - Good conversation can be forgotten a lot quicker than the branded pen a client finds at the bottom of their swag bag.
    - **`Logos provide a visual base to draw from for graphic design`** : 
      - Brand consistency is a key element in developing a lasting impression. 
      - By having a definitive representation of your brand at its most base level, you’ll have something to draw from when designing other marketing elements.
    - **`Logos help you stand out from the competition`**: 
      - Certain symbols or icons are associated with certain industries. 
      - Think of how many medical supply businesses use variations of a red cross in their logos. 
      - When there are a lot of businesses competing for the same market, distinguishing yourself is the key to getting noticed and remembered. 
  > A logo provides many advantages, so it’s not hard to understand why nearly every business has one.  
  > Going logo-less looks unprofessional.  
  > It comes across as illegitimate, even untrustworthy.

## 1 | Develop your brand identity
- “**`Brand Identity`**” is a catch-all term for the visual elements of your brand: 
- everything from your brand colors to your logo to the way elements of your brand are designed. 
- These visual elements work together to distinguish your brand in the minds of your customers. 
- Before you start sketching designs for your logo, you’ll want to have an idea of your brand’s identity. 
- To start, ask yourself these questions: 
  - [ ] Why did you start your business?
  - [ ] What values are important to you as a company?
  - [ ] What sets you apart from the competition?
- Your brand’s distinguishing features
  - [ ] what’s most important to you? 
  - [ ] what will be most recognizable to your customers
  - [ ] lie in the answers to these questions. 
- Before putting your pen to paper, before choosing your colors and aesthetics, ask yourself 
  - [ ] Who you are? 
- Don’t worry if you can’t answer these questions right away. 
- They’re a step-off point, meant to be pondered. 
- But once you’ve thought about it, you’ll be in a better position to create a logo that effectively sets you apart. 
- We started out by creating a “`mind map`” for our brand values. 
- Mind mapping is a visual brainstorming technique.
- You start with a central idea (your brand, in this case) and diagram your thoughts by connecting keywords and related concepts around that central idea. 
- Mind mapping can be done alone or in a group and is a great tool for refocusing your ideas or creating new ones. 
- In brand development, it’s perfect for coming to a consensus around a coherent brand identity.
> “`Mind mapping`” is a great technique for developing a coherent brand identity.

## 3 | Choose colors that reflect your brand
#### Color is more fundamental to a person’s perception of visual stimuli than many people realize. 
- Studies have even suggested that [color can affect your users’ mood](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/color-ux-conversion-rates), making it crucial to their buying decision.
- Your logo’s colors will end up on your website, in-store signage, social media feeds, marketing emails, and every other place where a user interacts with your brand. 
- There’s no color that’s universally “better,” but each color does say something different. 
- You want to make sure you’re saying the right thing. 
#### With that in mind, let’s go over the psychological effects of certain colors:
- **`Brown`**: 
  - An earthy tone, brown is often associated with all-natural ingredients, homemade goods, and freshly baked treats. Given its the color of tree bark, sticks, autumn leaves, and rich soil, brown can also give an outdoorsy aura to your brand.
  > MadeGood uses brown heavily in its packaging and marketing to invoke a sense of earthiness and memories of homemade baking.
- **`Orange`**: 
  - Like a roaring fire, orange radiates warmth, energy, and passion. 
  - The color of sunsets, it also tends to invoke summer—especially when paired with lighter blues and soft greens. 
  > Lumi’s orange-focused juice packaging brings to mind sparkling refreshment on a hot summer day.
- **`Yellow`**: 
  - Orange’s high-saturation sister, yellow, also gives off light, energy, and warmth. 
  - But if orange’s warmth is a glowing fireplace, yellow’s is the intense heat of a midday sun radiating over baron dessert. 
  - Yellow tends to invoke happy feelings, but use it sparingly. 
  - A little yellow can add a touch of optimism to a dependable brand, but a lot can be maniacal.
  > Perfume retailer Happiness Abscissa (Ha) uses yellow to add a feeling of optimism and joy.
- **`Green`**: 
  - A color with two personalities, green can invoke an organic aura that brings to mind lush rainforests, eco-awareness, and a sense of calm. 
  - And yet green just as easily becomes the color of money, greed, envy, and nausea.
