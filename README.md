# [How to Design a Memorable Logo in 7 Steps](https://www.shopify.in/blog/how-to-design-logo)
- #### Good logos stick. Bad ones don’t.
- North American Vexillological Association, says flag designs should be simple enough that a child can draw them from memory. 
- Your logo is not your brand—you build that separately—but it will become the face of your brand.
- It will appear on your website, your products, your marketing, your in-store signage, and just about any other place where people interact with your brand. 
- In this guide, we’ll walk you through every step of the process to create a business logo from scratch—from choosing a color to hiring a designer—with the help of real in-house graphic artists. 

## What is a business logo for?
- A logo is a symbol that represents your brand and your brand’s personality through the simplest image possible. 
- Logos embody your brand in the minds of your customers. 
- Without one, they have nothing to latch onto. 
  - Here’s why: 
    - **`Humans learn from visual cues`**: 
      - If there’s something about your brand you want your customers to know, science says images are more effective than words in communicating it.
    - **`Logos let you create branded swag`**: 
      - Branded swag can be handed out at trade shows, given as gifts to potential clients, and even sold in-store.
      - Good conversation can be forgotten a lot quicker than the branded pen a client finds at the bottom of their swag bag.
    - **`Logos provide a visual base to draw from for graphic design`** : 
      - Brand consistency is a key element in developing a lasting impression. 
      - By having a definitive representation of your brand at its most base level, you’ll have something to draw from when designing other marketing elements.
    - **`Logos help you stand out from the competition`**: 
      - Certain symbols or icons are associated with certain industries. 
      - Think of how many medical supply businesses use variations of a red cross in their logos. 
      - When there are a lot of businesses competing for the same market, distinguishing yourself is the key to getting noticed and remembered. 
  > A logo provides many advantages, so it’s not hard to understand why nearly every business has one.  
  > Going logo-less looks unprofessional.  
  > It comes across as illegitimate, even untrustworthy.

## 1 | Develop your brand identity
- “**`Brand Identity`**” is a catch-all term for the visual elements of your brand: 
- everything from your brand colors to your logo to the way elements of your brand are designed. 
- These visual elements work together to distinguish your brand in the minds of your customers. 
- Before you start sketching designs for your logo, you’ll want to have an idea of your brand’s identity. 
- To start, ask yourself these questions: 
  - [ ] Why did you start your business?
  - [ ] What values are important to you as a company?
  - [ ] What sets you apart from the competition?
- Your brand’s distinguishing features
  - [ ] what’s most important to you? 
  - [ ] what will be most recognizable to your customers
  - [ ] lie in the answers to these questions. 
- Before putting your pen to paper, before choosing your colors and aesthetics, ask yourself 
  - [ ] Who you are? 
- Don’t worry if you can’t answer these questions right away. 
- They’re a step-off point, meant to be pondered. 
- But once you’ve thought about it, you’ll be in a better position to create a logo that effectively sets you apart. 
- We started out by creating a “`mind map`” for our brand values. 
- Mind mapping is a visual brainstorming technique.
- You start with a central idea (your brand, in this case) and diagram your thoughts by connecting keywords and related concepts around that central idea. 
- Mind mapping can be done alone or in a group and is a great tool for refocusing your ideas or creating new ones. 
- In brand development, it’s perfect for coming to a consensus around a coherent brand identity.
