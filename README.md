# How to Design a Memorable Logo in 7 Steps
- #### Good logos stick. Bad ones don’t.
- North American Vexillological Association, says flag designs should be simple enough that a child can draw them from memory. 
- Your logo is not your brand—you build that separately—but it will become the face of your brand.
- It will appear on your website, your products, your marketing, your in-store signage, and just about any other place where people interact with your brand. 
- In this guide, we’ll walk you through every step of the process to create a business logo from scratch—from choosing a color to hiring a designer—with the help of real in-house graphic artists. 

## What is a business logo for?
- A logo is a symbol that represents your brand and your brand’s personality through the simplest image possible. 
- Logos embody your brand in the minds of your customers. 
- Without one, they have nothing to latch onto. 
  - Here’s why: 
    - **`Humans learn from visual cues`**: 
      - If there’s something about your brand you want your customers to know, science says images are more effective than words in communicating it.
    - **`Logos let you create branded swag`**: 
      - Branded swag can be handed out at trade shows, given as gifts to potential clients, and even sold in-store.
      - Good conversation can be forgotten a lot quicker than the branded pen a client finds at the bottom of their swag bag.
    - **`Logos provide a visual base to draw from for graphic design`** : 
      - Brand consistency is a key element in developing a lasting impression. 
      - By having a definitive representation of your brand at its most base level, you’ll have something to draw from when designing other marketing elements.
    - **`Logos help you stand out from the competition`**: 
      - Certain symbols or icons are associated with certain industries. 
      - Think of how many medical supply businesses use variations of a red cross in their logos. 
      - When there are a lot of businesses competing for the same market, distinguishing yourself is the key to getting noticed and remembered. 
  > A logo provides many advantages, so it’s not hard to understand why nearly every business has one.  
  > Going logo-less looks unprofessional.  
  > It comes across as illegitimate, even untrustworthy.
